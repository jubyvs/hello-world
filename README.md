# Goals for web design

### A brief intro
I am a professional web developer with 2 to 3 years of experience. Although I have experience with some backend languages like Python and Golang, my expertise lies in front-end development. Nevertheless, I feel that I am incomplete as I am not a designer and have to rely on others for my designs. 

### Why do i want to become a designer?
The demand for Web developers has dramatically increased in recent years. Since the pandemic has hit, all work environments have been converted to remote. Undoubtedly, this increases competition. As a result, you need to know what's new with tech trends and cutting-edge technologies, so you are always on top of the game. So, I decided not to rely on other designers for this part and instead wanted to take things in-house, combining my DevOps skills with my design skills to make myself a strong competitor. It's imperative for me to learn some basic skills and other tools so that I can develop them further.
